"""Pure chart rendering primitives.

This module is the shared rendering kernel for the ``chart`` frame (standalone
star history) and the embedded chart zone inside the ``stats`` frame's
``chrome`` paradigm. It takes a list of data points, a viewport rect, and a
small dict of structural hints (``stroke_linejoin``, ``data_point_shape``,
``fill_density``) and returns a dict of structured render data ready for
Jinja templates to iterate + include.

Architectural rules (Invariants 1 + 6):
    - Zero network I/O. Fetching happens at the CLI/HTTP layer before compose.
    - Zero CSS. Colors are passed as ``var(--dna-*)`` references by callers.
    - Zero SVG string assembly. Every visual element returns as structured
      Python data (dicts / list[dict]); templates under
      ``templates/components/chart-*.svg.j2`` render the final markup.
    - Pure functions. No classes, no state.

Public API:
    :func:`build_chart_svg` is the single entry point. It returns a dict:

        - ``axes``, ``gridlines``, ``markers``, ``milestones`` → ``list[dict]``
        - ``area``, ``polyline``, ``empty_state`` → ``dict`` or ``None``
        - ``y_labels``, ``x_labels`` → ``list[dict]`` for axis tick labels
        - ``defs`` → ``str`` (reserved for future per-chart CSS/filters)

    Templates iterate the lists and guard the optional dicts with ``{% if %}``;
    each element maps to a small Jinja partial such as
    ``components/chart-polyline.svg.j2``.

    This is the same curve D3 renders via ``curveMonotoneX``. For data with
    monotonically increasing x-coordinates (e.g. any time-series chart like
    star history), the curve is guaranteed to:

    - Pass through every anchor point (C0 continuity).
    - Be C1-continuous (smooth tangent at every anchor).
    - Be monotonic wherever the input is monotonic (no dips between rising
      points).
    - Not overshoot — control handles stay within their segment in x,
      regardless of uneven x-spacing.

    The previous implementation placed horizontal control handles at every
    anchor (``c1y = y_prev``, ``c2y = y_cur``). That shape produced two
    visual artifacts on real data:

    1. **Flat-then-vertical** for bursty growth — horizontal tangents forced
       each segment into a plateau → S-curve → plateau shape, so the chart
       read as flat sections punctuated by sharp rises.

    2. **Self-intersecting segments** when two adjacent anchors were close
       in x — the hard-coded ``dx = max(4, (x_cur - x_prev) // 3)`` produced
       ``c2.x < c1.x``, rasterizing badly on mobile/Camo.

    Fritsch-Carlson solves both by computing per-segment slopes, deriving a
    tangent at each point from the neighboring slopes, and then rescaling
    tangent magnitudes with the ``α² + β² > 9`` test so control handles
    never extend past their segment.

       a continuous trend bottom-left dim → top-right bright. This IS the

    2. **±0.08 hash perturbation** — a small per-cell offset from Knuth's
       multiplicative hash adds organic variance without producing outliers.
       At ±0.08 (half of one chart_levels segment width), some cells cross

    v0.3.9 Bug #4 refactor: pre-fix this was STEP-driven (fixed 7-day
    step for spans <90d, 30-day step for <2y, etc.), producing 8+ weekly
    labels on short-span repos and dense monthly labels on multi-year
    spans. Now COUNT-DRIVEN: target ~6 labels, compute the raw step
    (span / (count-1)), then snap to the nearest "nice" interval from a
    curated vocabulary spanning days→years. Result: a 50-day span gets
    ~4-5 biweekly labels; a 10-year span gets ~5 every-other-year labels.
    Label count stays roughly constant regardless of span — the
    star-history.com pattern the user referenced.

    A single-point input renders one centered label with full "%b %d, %Y".
    After candidate generation, a width-aware de-overlap pass removes any
    middle label whose bounding box would touch the previously-kept one
    (see ``_labels_collide``). The first and last labels are preserved
    unconditionally because they're the temporal endpoints a reader
    expects to see.
